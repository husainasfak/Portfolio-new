# Docker Introduction

This is an introduction to Docker...

## Key Concepts

- Containers
- Images
- Dockerfile

## Example Code

```javascript
console.log("hello");
```

In the above example the element `<Blog />` basically houses the common layout/logic for all of the children below it. It specifically needs to render an `<Outlet />` to define where the nested routes will render.
That's basically the same exact idea here in Remix, except that structure is being defined using the file system. Once I wrapped my head around that it made a litte bit more sense.

### Now back to syntax highlighting...

Now that we have that structure in place, the only thing left to do is setup up our `highlight.js` CSS file to specifically load in _only_ for our blog routing. This is because we likely won't need those styles anywhere else but in the blog posts.

In addition to that Remix seems to optimize what CSS is sent _per page_. Meaning to enable our syntax highlighting we'd have to include the styles in each page. That seems overkill, so instead we're going to load it inside our `blog.tsx` (which again remember wraps the underlying nested children) so that we only define it once across all blog posts.

```ts
import styles from "highlight.js/styles/github-dark-dimmed.css"; // change this to your desired theme
import type { LinksFunction, LoaderFunction } from "remix";
import { MetaFunction, Outlet } from "remix";

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    {
      rel: "stylesheet",
      href: styles,
    },
  ];
};

export default function Blog() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

Now if you're able to see all of the above code blocks with proper highlighting then I must've done it right!

## Where to go from here

- In general the site's stlyes and look/feel is still pretty plain. I'll need to improve that to something... reasonable.
  - Looking to add tailwind since I've been wanting to learn that anyways
- A challenge to figure out: how to display nested attributes from the parent `blog.tsx`? For example what if I wanted to determine the title or date of a specific blog post so that I can render it consistently across all posts?
  - Actually I noticed Kent C. Dodd's blog doesn't utilize Remix's built-in MDX route modules. I have a feeling it's because of maybe one of these concerns
- I need to improve the [base blog page](/blog) to dynamically determine the full list of blog posts
  - I'll probably need to read from the file system then utilize frontmatter to determine titles, dates, etc.

Anyways that's it for now!
